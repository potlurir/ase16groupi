## Project Idea 

### "OLD idea: [Solving Vehicle Routing Problem using Ant Colony Optimization](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/blob/master/project/ProjectIdea-Old.md)"

### "Current Idea: Meta-heuristic Approaches to Solving Next Release Problem"

### The project report can be read [here](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/blob/master/project/ProjectReport.pdf)

### Source code files are [here](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/tree/master/project/code)

### How to run:
The NRP model being used by DE and GA are here. [nrp.py](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/blob/master/project/code/nrp.py)
The DE and GA codes are in [de.py](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/blob/master/project/code/de.py)

`$ python de.py`

The hyperparameter tunining module is in [tuner.py](https://github.com/rpotluri12/ase16groupi/blob/master/project/code/tuner.py)

`$ python tuner.py`
