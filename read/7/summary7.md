#### 2. Keywords:

ii1. *Bug report* - A software bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result or to behave in unintended ways. A report which explains what exaclty the bug is or how the system is broken

ii2. *Android* : Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

ii3.  *Auto-completion* - Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. 

ii4. *STR(reproduction steps)* : The steps to reproduce (STR) must be as clear as possible, preferably with screenshots and/or test data. The steps should also be definite. 

**iii. Brief Notes**

iii1. *Motivational statements* : The complexity of “apps” has been increasing, making development and maintenance challenging. Additionally, current bug tracking systems are not able to effectively support construction of reports  with actionable information that directly lead to a bug’s resolution. Software maintenance activities are known to be generally expensive and challenging [69]. One of the most important maintenance tasks is bug report resolution.

iii2. *Study Instruments* - They manually selected bug reports from Android Open Source apps at FDroid. They crawled the links of the issue tracking systems of the apps and then manually inspected the bug reports for each project where F-droid had a linked issue tracker

iii3. *Hypothesis* : FUSION encourages a new direction of research aimed at improving reporting systems. It reduces the lexical gap between reporters of bugs and developers

iii4. *Future Work* : Improve the DFS engine through supporting more gestures, to explore adding more specific program information in reports for quicker/automatic fault localization, and to use FUSION as a tool for reporting feature requests

**iv. Improvements**

iv1. Again this model should be tested in a real environment and see how exactly a tester would use this application and benefit from it

iv2. As this paper is also aimed at promoting research it is important to provide further documentation as to how to use this application and tutorials on how this paper can be used in generating and evaluating new ideas
